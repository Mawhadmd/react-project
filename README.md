# This is currently a demo

The service works as follows:
any user that owns a social media precense.

Uploaading one video to many platforms can be a hassle, so instead, by using thiis service, you can upload your video on only one platform and this service will do the rest. This is planned to be working with youtube, instagraaam, and maybe tiktok. Since These are the most dominating platforms at the moment for short form content. 

This project is in testing/alpha.

The project was built with React, React-Router, Tailwind, and is deployed on vercel.
